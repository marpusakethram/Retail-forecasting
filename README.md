Objective: The code will provide a time series forecasting of item sales at a store level. It leverages historical sales to train a machine learning model that can be used to forecast future demand. This solution is important for inventory because the store will be able to anticipate the future sales of a particular item by maintaining optimal stock and hence reducing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.

How It Solves Supply Chain Problems:
1. Demand Forecasting: The model supports the store manager in predicting future sales of items for better demand forecasting. This ensures better inventory management-preventing instances of stockouts or excess inventory.
2. More Efficiency: Using historical data with enhanced models, the system improves efficiency in the stocking of items. This reduces costs associated with storage and missed sales opportunities.
3. Cost Savings: Correct demand forecasting ensures proper resource allocation and reduces waste or the need for emergency restocking, which translates into cost savings throughout the supply chain.

 Tech Stack:
 Libraries: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: For data manipulation and handling.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `lightgbm`: Light Gradient Boosting Machine, used for building and training the forecasting model.
The libraries and their uses are as follows:Â 
- `statsmodels`: Time series models including ARIMA, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing.
- `sklearn`: for error metrics like mean absolute error.
Techniques
Time series decomposition
ARIMA, SARIMAX for time series forecasting
Gradient boosting with LightGBM for prediction modeling

The presented methods and tools form a potent combination, hence this is an effective solution for real-time sales forecasting in the retail domain, which eventually addresses some of the common supply chain challenges in retailing industries: fluctuations in demand and mismanagement of inventory.
